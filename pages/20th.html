<p>In 2011, Sega has made an announcement for "Puyo Puyo!!" to be released in the same year 
to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the series, following up the 15th anniversary "Puyo 
Puyo!" (note the numbers of exclamation marks) It is not yet released at time of writing.</p>

<p>From the current information available, the game will feature a cast of 24 characters which 
will be a mix of 7, Fever and classic casts. The game will have 15 modes of multiplayer, with 
4 standard modes (Original, Tsuu, Fever and Mission), 3 legacy modes (Sun, Mega Rush and
Mini Fever) and the rest will be new modes (mostly gimmicks). Presumably the format of the game 
will follow that of the 15th Anniversary Edition's although more information will need to be 
released for us to have a better picture of what the game will be like.</p>

<p>This article will be updated as more information about the game is released or after the game 
itself is released, depending on the availability and interest of its authors.</p>
