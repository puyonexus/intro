<h1>Other Notable Puyo Games and Spin-Offs</h1>
	
<p>As with almost any other game company with a successful franchise, Compile tried to 
heavily capitalize on Madou Monogatari and Puyo Puyo with various games and merchandise. 
Many side games and spin-offs were developed by them which resulted in many interesting and 
sometimes downright strange titles affiliated with the series. Here are some examples.</p>

<h2>Disc Station Games</h2>
<p>Disc Station was the name of a disc magazine that was made by Compile between 1988 and 1992. 
The idea is that they are pretty much gaming magazines complete with articles and other 
magazine-ish things. The magazines were floppy disks but later, between 1993 and 2000, 
they became actual magazines with CD ROMs and included such things as trailers, skits, 
programs and free games.</p>

	</ul>

<p>Many of these games included Madou Monogatari/Puyo Puyo characters and they are very much 
worth checking out for Madou and Puyo fans. Notable ones include Comet Summoner, PuyoLympics, 
Madou RUN, Hasamuncho and some even have <a href="http://www.puyonexus.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=41">English translation patches</a> available from Puyo Nexus.</p>

<h2>Nazo Puyo Series</h2>
<p>These were developed by Compile in the 90s and they are spin-offs of the Mission mode 
(Nazo Puyo mode in Japanese) found in the early Puyo games. Apart from having to clear 
the entire board, though, there will be other objectives you have to complete such as 
clearing all Puyo of a certain color. Unlike the main Puyo series they are singleplayer games.</p>

<h2>Waku Waku Puyo Puyo Dungeon</h2>
<p>Waku Waku Puyo Puyo Dungeon is a roguelike RPG game with randomly generated dungeons for 
Arle, Rulue and Schezo to explore. The game doesn't play like the previous RPG's, the Madou 
Monogatari series, as the main characters battle in real time by standing next to the enemy and attacking.</p>

<h2>Puyo Wars</h2>
<p>A spin-off game released in 1999 for the Game Boy Color in the style of Super Robot Wars. 
It's set in a futuristic universe where people fight with robots with the power of Puyo.</p>

	<li>Um...yeah, robots and stuff.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Puyo Puyo DA!</h2>
<p>Arguably the weirdest Puyo spin-off ever made, DA! was released in 1999 and is some sort of 
a dancing simulator. Unlike most other rhythm-matching games the game was controlled with a 
normal controller. DA! is actually based on an old Disc Station game called Broadway Legend 
Ellena, who appears in the game. Since Compile probably thought she wasn't solid enough to 
stand on her own they decided to strengthen the game's marketability with Madou Monogatari 
characters (to be fair to poor Ellena, the Puyo series pretty much got the same treatment).</p>

	<li>This game is extremely notable due to Satan's fish net shirt and Suketoudara's tutu.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Arle's Adventure</h2>
<p>A monster fighting and collection game released in 2000, riding on the crest of the Pokemon 
tsunami. You can control Arle in fights as well as two monsters that you capture by fighting 
them and collecting their cards.</p>

<h2>Puyo Puyo Box</h2>
<p>Puyo Puyo Box is a compilation game released in 2000, which included the game rules 
from all four main Compile's Puyo titles 
and could be seen as a precursor to the Anniversary Edition games developed by Sega. The 
game also came with a Quest mode, which was basically your standard JRPG, but instead of 
fighting battles normally you fight them by playing Puyo matches with the enemy.</p>

<h2>Minna de Puyo Puyo (Puyo Pop)</h2>
<p>Minna de Puyo Puyo, directly translated to Everybody Puyo Puyo in English but was localized 
and released in the West as Puyo Pop, was developed by Sega for the Game Boy Advance in 
2001. This game is quite notable for being the first Puyo game developed solely by Sega 
and also for being the first Puyo game that was localized in English, not including the 
clones of the original Puyo Puyo.</p>

	</ul>
	
<p>In this game Sega decided to go back to the basic, utilising the Tsuu rule for the gameplay. 
Much of the main cast is available and the story follows Arle trying to retrieve Carbuncle 
who has gotten lost, collecting pieces of artifacts at the same time. (Also should I even 
bother mentioning Satan has another plot?)</p>

	<ul class="imglist">

	</ul>
	
<p>Interestingly, the original Japanese release actually came with an option to change the 
language to English, which translated all the menu and scripts in the game. The English 
version, Puyo Pop, however, retranslated the script while taking more liberty with the 
original script, whereas the other pretty much followed the Japanese script quite faithfully.</p>

	<ul class="imglist">
	<li><a href="images/pop1.png" class="fancybox" title="A new adventure for Arle and Carbuncle">

	<li><a href="images/pop2.png" class="fancybox" title="Noooooo!!">
	<img src="images/pop2.png" class="thumb_small" alt="Old teabags"></a></li>
	</ul>
	
<p>The retranslation resulted in some deliciously hilarious exchanges between the characters 
and it is definitely worth checking out just to witness Arle at the peak of her sarcasm 
and loathing for her fellow Puyokind, before Sega decided to completely destroy her 
characterization in the Fever series.</p>
