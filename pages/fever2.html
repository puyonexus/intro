<p>The next installment to the series was released in 2005 as Puyo Puyo Fever Chuu! 
or Puyo Puyo Fever 2: Chuu!, depending how you want to interpret the logo. "Chuu" 
is a pun on the English "two" and is also the Japanese sound for kissing. As the title 
suggests the game is a continuation of the Fever series and sees the return of the Fever 
cast, plus more. The game officially fits into the Puyo series as the 6th game and, 
while not present in the title, references to this were made in its marketing.</p>

	</ul>
	
<p>The story mode this time still has 3 courses for the 3 difficulties as usual, but each 
course can be played with either of the three main characters: Amitie, Raffine or the newly 
introduced Sig. The scope of the singleplayer game was also greatly expanded with the menu 
being a map where you can travel to different locations to play different modes, such as story, 
multiplayer, tower challenge and even a FABULOUS item shop run by Oshare Bones.</p>

<p>Even though the storyline of the previous game was never resolved properly, Sega decided 
to drop it completely in favor of a new storyline centered around Klug unknowingly unleashing 
an ancient evil. Several new characters were also introduced such as the following.</p>
	
	<table>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ppf_sig.png" class="fancybox" title="Sig">
	<img src="images/ppf_sig.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Sig"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Sig</strong><br>A spacey boy who is a new student of the Primp Magic School. He has an asymmetrical 
	design with a red left eye and a blue right eye, and his left hand resembles that of a 
	demonic claw. He also has an obsession with insects and his attacks are based on the color blue.
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ppf_fel.png" class="fancybox" title="Feli">
	<img src="images/ppf_fel.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Feli"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Feli</strong><br>A girl sporting Gothic Lolita clothing who studies in a magic school in a bordering 
	town of Primp. She is always seen with dowsing rods and uses astrological magic.
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ppf_lem.png" class="fancybox" title="Lemres">
	<img src="images/ppf_lem.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Lemres"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Lemres</strong><br>A senior from the same school as Feli. He is the object of Feli's obsession and 
	Klug's admiration as a capable wizard. He seems to love candy and would offer them to passing 
	strangers. His attacks are also based on sweets.
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ppf_aku.png" class="fancybox" title="Akuma">
	<img src="images/ppf_aku.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Akuma"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Akuma</strong><br>Rather than an overpowered black-clad Ryu clone, Puyo's Akuma is a wise old demon who 
	takes the form of a black bear. He is the keeper of the library and uses elemental magic 
	incanted in Sanskrit. His name is a pun on "akuma" which mean "demon" and "kuma" which means "bear".
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ppf_rei.png" class="fancybox" title="Rei">
	<img src="images/ppf_rei.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Rei"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Rei</strong><br>Yu's brother, who is also a ghost. Unlike Yu he doesn't talk much but they seem to get 
	along well. He is clumped with Yu as one playable character under the name "Yu & Rei", a pun 
	on the Japanese word for ghost, "yurei".
	</td></tr></table>

<p>Gameplay-wise, Fever 2 kept pretty much the same Fever rule as from the first Fever game, 
with slight adjustments that are not worth worrying about. In the story mode, items could 
be bought from the shop that let you gain advantage if you have them selected at the beginning 
of battles.</p>

	<ul class="imglist">
	<li><a href="images/ppf2_battle.png" class="fancybox" title="Battle">
	<img src="images/ppf2_battle.png" class="thumb_small" alt="Battle"></a></li>
	<li><a href="images/ppf2_fever.png" class="fancybox" title="Fever mode">
	<img src="images/ppf2_fever.png" class="thumb_small" alt="Fever mode"></a></li>
	<li><a href="images/ppf2_chu.png" class="fancybox" title="Endless Chuu Panic Mode">
	<img src="images/ppf2_chu.png" class="thumb_small" alt="Endless Chuu Panic Mode"></a></li>
	</ul>
	
<p>Another addition is the Endless Chuu Panic mode. Like any other Puyo game, Fever 2 comes 
with Endless modes that let you practice your chaining without having to worry about the 
pressure of playing against an opponent. The difference in Chuu Panic mode is that while 
playing, Chuu Puyo, which are literally pink-colored Nuisance Puyo, will fall randomly on 
the screen. The Chuu Puyo don't appear in any other modes besides this.</p>

<p>Possibly due to Puyo Pop Fever's unsatisfactory performance in the West, Puyo Puyo Fever 
Chuu! was never localized in English. A translation project is currently under way at Puyo 
Nexus to translate the PS2 version but at time of writing the project is on hiatus.</p>
