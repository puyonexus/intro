<p>The next installment into the main series was released in 2009 under the name Puyo Puyo 7, 
ending a long tradition of punny titles. Sega justified this by saying that 7 is a lucky 
number and they also wanted to emphasise Puyo's long history and the fact that we are 
already seven games into it. (Given how much they struggled to make the pun "Fever 
Chuu!" relevant in that game with Chuu Panic mode, it is more likely they just simply 
ran out of ideas and stopped trying.)</p>

<p>As with Fever 2, Sega again decided to drop the story developments introduced previously 
and took it further by setting 7 in a completely different universe. This time, the story 
begins in Japan in a universe not so different to our own (except for the fact you can get 
from Japan to Easter Island by train!), where we are introduced to another set of three new 
characters.</p>

	<table>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ringo.png" class="fancybox" title="Ringo">
	<img src="images/ringo.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Ringo"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Ringo Andou</strong><br>A schoolgirl who attends Suzuran High School and lives in a nearby shopping 
	district where her family runs a grocery store. She is a member of the Physics club although 
	it is actually more of a slack-off club where they just do anything. She appears to be a maths 
	geek since most of her attack shouts are based on it.
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/maguro.png" class="fancybox" title="Maguro">
	<img src="images/maguro.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Maguro"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Maguro Sasaki</strong><br>A schoolmate and neighbor of Ringo. His family runs a fishmonger's in the shopping 
	district. He's a fabulous type of guy although not quite capital-letter FABULOUS like Oshare Bones. 
	He carries around a kendama with him, which is a type of traditional Japanese toy you can do 
	tricks with (somewhat like a yo-yo). His attacks are based on kendama tricks.
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/risukuma.png" class="fancybox" title="Risukuma">
	<img src="images/risukuma.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Risukuma"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Risukuma</strong><br>Some sort of freak bear-squirrel hybrid ("Risu" = squirrel, "Kuma" = bear), this  
	unholy creature is actually a senior of Ringo and Maguro at the high school. He's a member of 
	the Chemistry club, but after their clubroom was destroyed in an accident about 3 months prior 
	to the game events he is in the process of squatting in the Physics clubroom. Because Sega 
	didn't think he was creepy enough already they also gave him attacks based on the phase "I 
	love you" in different languages.
	</td></tr></table>

<p>These three are also joined by many of the Fever cast and the classic cast, who were 
transported to their universe similarly to how the classic cast were transported to the 
Fever universe in previous games. In addition to some of the characters found in 15th 
Anniversary some popular classic characters such as Draco and Skeleton-T made a return.</p>

<p>Along with these characters, a huge amount of Puyo was also dumped from a dimensional 
rift into her universe. Ringo, armed with the knowledge of how to clear the Puyo taught 
to her by Arle, then sets out to solve the mystery of these strange occurrences.</p>
	
	<ul class="imglist">
	<li><a href="images/pp7_henshin.png" class="fancybox" title="Transform!">
	<img src="images/pp7_henshin.png" class="thumb_small" alt="Transform!"></a></li>
	</ul>
	
<p>A new multiplayer rule has been added to the game called Transformation. In this rule, 
a gauge similar to the Fever gauge can be filled up to set off Transformation mode. 
Transformation mode is actually two different types of special mode, Mini Puyo Fever and 
Mega Puyo Rush. Cosmetically, the character will then transform into a "child" or "adult" 
form when going into these respective modes. At the beginning of the game, the player 
can choose which mode they want to use.</p>

	<ul class="imglist">
	<li><a href="images/pp7_mini2.png" class="fancybox" title="Child Ringo.">
	<img src="images/pp7_mini2.png" class="thumb_small" alt="Child Ringo"></a></li>
	<li><a href="images/pp7_mini.png" class="fancybox" title="Mini Puyo Fever.">
	<img src="images/pp7_mini.png" class="thumb_small" alt="Mini Puyo Fever"></a></li>
	</ul>
	
<p>In both of these modes, the players become invincible and any garbage on their garbage bar 
will be held until the timer runs out. Mini Puyo Fever is extremely similar to the Fever 
mode present in the Fever series, but now the Puyo will be much smaller so a lot more of 
them will fit on the screen at once and hence much bigger chains can be made. Like in 
Fever, bigger pre-made chains will be given to you the higher you advance.</p>
	
	<ul class="imglist">
	<li><a href="images/pp7_mega2.png" class="fancybox" title="Adult Ringo">
	<img src="images/pp7_mega2.png" class="thumb_small" alt="Adult Ringo"></a></li>
	<li><a href="images/pp7_mega.png" class="fancybox" title="Mega Puyo Rush.">
	<img src="images/pp7_mega.png" class="thumb_small" alt="Mega Puyo Rush"></a></li>
	</ul>
	
<p>In Mega Puyo Rush, the Puyo are now much bigger and hence less will fit on the screen. 
Unlike Mini Puyo Fever, no pre-made chain is given to you, but a new type of chaining 
mechanic called "cumulative chaining" is used, so rather than every chain power being 
determined solely by its length, the more chains you make in Mega Rush, the stronger 
the next chain becomes.</p>
	
	<ul class="imglist">
	<li><a href="images/pp7_quick.png" class="fancybox" title="Quick drop.">
	<img src="images/pp7_quick.png" class="thumb_small" alt="Quick drop"></a></li>
	</ul>

<p>In addition, a new "quick drop" button was added. This works like Tetris's hard drop, 
where pressing up will make the current piece locks down instantly.</p>

<p>While Transformation works similarly to Fever, the largest difference is probably 
the invincibility it gives. This makes Transformation much safer than Fever, although 
as a trade-off the power inside Transformation mode is extremely weak compared to Fever. 
This means at early stages in Transformation, it is very hard to do damage and for the 
player it feels more like being trapped there. At later stages though it can be pretty 
devastating.</p>

	<img src="images/pp7_result.png" class="thumb_small" alt="S-rank"></a></li>
	</ul>

<p>Many players enjoyed Transformation as an interesting retake on the Fever mechanics. In 
competitive circles, though, Transformation was not quite received as well as Fever was. 
Many players feel that Mini Fever and Mega Rush was not well-balanced, and that 
Transformation rule drags the game out with its in-Transformation invincibility (that 
can actually last 99 seconds maximum!), which they also say takes much of the risk out of the game.</p>

<p>Quick drop was relatively more well-received and many players thought it was a fun gimmick 
to play with, although they don't see it as having much of a place in serious competitive 
play. Since the speed of Puyo popping is the main bottleneck in limiting the speed of play 
for competitive players, quick drop doesn't make a lot of difference in that regard.</p>

	</ul>
	
<p>For fans of the series, another criticism they had for the game was that the character 
roster was heavily reduced, and while most main characters made the cut, a lot of fan 
favourites were left out. (To add insult to the injury, Witch and Harpy made cameo 
appearances in the story but were not playable characters.) Many graphical effects 
such as unique attack animation were omitted compared to the rest of Sega's Puyo games, 
and while it was understandable since all characters now have extra animation for Mini 
and Mega modes, the decision was poorly received. On the up side, the Mini and Mega designs 
for most characters were very well done and earned many fans.</p>
