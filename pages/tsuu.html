<p>The sequel to the original Puyo Puyo was first released in 1994. The title, 
Tsuu, is a Japanese word for master, but read out loud it is a homophone to 
the Japanese pronunciation of the English word "Two", essentially making a pun out 
of the title "Puyo Puyo 2". This is a theme that will continue with almost all 
the sequels of the main Puyo series.</p>

<p>On the surface, the player will notice straight away that the story mode 
has been greatly expanded from the previous release, again centered around 
another one of Satan's harebrained plot, with many more characters introduced 
from the Madou Monogatari series and the story advancing on a "tier-based" 
system rather than the linear progression of the previous game.</p>

<p>The huge change to the game, however, was to be found in the game mechanic. 
A seemingly simple addition was put in the system, where if your opponent 
has sent garbage over to you, rather than standing and taking it, you could 
set off your own chain and use the garbage you have generated to offset it 
before it has a chance to fall into your screen. If the strength of your chain 
exceeds that of your opponent's you can even counter attack them with the extra garbage.</p>

<p>The change may have been simple but it completely revolutionized the way Puyo 
was played competitively. Without "offsetting" the viable strategies in the 
original Puyo were mostly limited to making quick chains to beat your opponent. 
With offsetting however, a whole new world of strategies opened up. You can't get 
away anymore by simply making a 4-5 chain, which previously was enough to fill 
up the opponent's entire screen. More advanced players had to learn to make much 
larger chains to keep the edge in the game. Techniques and strategies such as 
watching the opponent screen, baiting, chain-cutting, etc. became relevant or 
even more crucial than they were before.</p>

<p>The Tsuu rule, as it is called, has become widely accepted as the standard for 
Puyo battles and even now the game, or at least the rule, is used in tournament 
matches. While subsequent sequels have tried to introduce new mechanics into Puyo, 
they are usually regarded as rather gimmicky and don't contribute to the competitive 
potential of the game, and the Tsuu rule retains its crown as the definitive Puyo 
rule, and all sequels keep the Tsuu rule as a selectable 
alternative to whatever rules that game decided to include.</p>

<p>The game also received a "Remix" version which improved upon the original Super Famicom 
(SNES) version, including some new modes which expands the gameplay significantly, but 
the definitive version for the game would be the PSX and Saturn releases that come with 
full voice acting for the cutscenes. For English-speaking fans though, one should pick 
up the original Super Famicom release since it is the only version of Tsuu you can find 
a <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/trans/465/">translation patch</a> for. The arcade version 
remains the standard for tournament battles to this day.</p>
