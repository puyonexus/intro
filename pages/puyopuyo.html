<p>As we touched on previously, the first Puyo Puyo game was released in 1991, 
the brainchild of designer Moo Niitani (real name Masamitsu Niitani). The first home 
releases were very simple, with only single player modes where you can either make chains 
endlessly for highscores or the "Mission" mode where you have to clear preset boards with 
certain numbers of Puyo.</p>

<p>Puyo really became what we know it as today with the arcade release a year later, also 
called Puyo Puyo, but with a competitive multiplayer mode added. It also added a story mode, 
populated with Madou Monogatari characters. While the MM games have some sort of semblance 
to a coherent plot and believability, the Puyo games have taken the characters and even 
minor villains from the games and turn them into hilarious caricatures. Some of the characters 
you will find include:</p>

		</td><td>
			<strong>Arle Nadja</strong><br>The heroine of the series who loves curry. She uses 
			elemental magic and her battlecries will be stuck in your head forever and ever. Her

			dismayed at the actions of other characters.

<p>There are also many more characters but these are the main ones, most of whom 
recur throughout the whole series, even in the newer games where most of the original 
cast has been discarded.</p>

<p>The mechanics of the game is exactly as described in the introduction. You make 
chains and drop garbage on the opponent field. This is the competitive Puyo at its 
simplest form. In single-player battles, each CPU will even have their own strategy 
for playing, such as Suketoudara firing quick 2-3 chains at you, Harpy stacking Puyo 
on the left and rightmost columns to try to make "luck" chains and Skeleton-T's strategy 
seems to involve him mashing his face into the controller. It is a nice touch and 
indeed many human players will utilize similar strategies to these CPU players.</p>

<p>A notable fact about this game is that it spawned quite a few official clones that 
were distributed in the West, and since the original was never released on consoles 
in English, these clone versions were the games that introduced many Western players 
to the series. Puyo Puyo was licensed to Sega who replaced the cast with Sonic 
characters and called it Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine and to Nintendo who did 
the same with Kirby characters and renamed it Kirby's Avalanche (Kirby's Ghost Trap 
in Europe). There are also various other lesser-known clones, such as a Lion King-themed 
one called Timon and Pumbaa's Bug Drop and Qwirks, a generic clone marketed with the name 
of creator of Tetris, Alexey Pajitnov, despite him not being involved in any way with the game.</p>

<p>For those of you who feel like going through the story mode with hilarious pseudo-English 
translation, an English version of the arcade release can be found by looking for the ROM 
called "Puyo Puyo (World)".</p>
