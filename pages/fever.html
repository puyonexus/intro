<p>After Compile disbanded, Sega (who now owns the game license) finally decided to continue the Puyo series with its own 
installment in 2004. The name Fever is a play on the word "five", 
since the game is the fifth installment, and was released in English as Puyo Pop Fever. 
Sonic Team, the developers of the Sonic franchise (as the name implies), was put in 
charge of developing the game.</p>

<p>In Fever, Sega decided to completely "reboot" the series, with a whole new cast and 
a different art direction. The artwork is very reminiscent of Sonic games with stylised bold 
outlines and stringy limbs, as opposed to the conventional anime style used in previous games. 
The entire cast was done away with, apart from Arle and Carbuncle, and we are introduced to a 
completely new set of characters such as the following.</p>
	
	<table>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ppf_ami.png" class="fancybox" title="Amitie">
	<img src="images/ppf_ami.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Amitie"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Amitie</strong><br>A spunky and well-meaning student of magic who doesn't have much up there. She 
	and her friends study in a magic school located in Primp Town. She uses similar magic to 
	Arle and replaces her as the main character of the series. She always wear a red Puyo hat 
	which she treasures.
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ppf_raf.png" class="fancybox" title="Raffine">
	<img src="images/ppf_raf.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Raffine"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Raffine</strong><br>A ladylike student of the magic school. She is a capable martial artist although 
	she is not very good at magic, resorting to using items to enhance her fighting skills. 
	Her character is set up to be Amitie's rival although their rivalry was never established like 
	Arle and Rulue's. Most fans either find her personality very cute or very grating.
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ppf_klu.png" class="fancybox" title="Klug">
	<img src="images/ppf_klu.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Klug"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Klug</strong><br> The typical nerdy type of character. He's the best student in the class but, in a typical 
	anime fashion, still gets regularly beaten by more important characters. He carries around 
	a haunted book which no one seems to mind and uses astronomical magic.
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ppf_rid.png" class="fancybox" title="Rider">
	<img src="images/ppf_rid.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Rider"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Rider</strong><br> A shy and timid girl who has long horns on her head that she is very self-conscious 
	about and tries to hide it by wrapping her hair around them. She has the power to control 
	lightning. Her name is actually pronounced something similar to "Riddel" and was famously 
	mispronounced by Amitie in the English version as Rita.
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ppf_tar.png" class="fancybox" title="Tarutaru">
	<img src="images/ppf_tar.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Tarutaru"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Tarutaru</strong><br>A huge student with a typical crush on the alpha female of the school, Raffine. 
	His power is based on plain attacks such as stomping and tackling. He's such a boring 
	character that even the designer named him Tarutaru which roughly translates to "ordinary". 
	Pretty forgettable.
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ppf_acc.png" class="fancybox" title="Ms. Accord">
	<img src="images/ppf_acc.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Ms. Accord"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Ms. Accord</strong><br> The teacher at Primp Magic School ( the only one apparently doing the job, 
	although given there are around 5 students there it's not surprising). She carries around 
	a talking cat puppet called Popoi. In the story, she has lost her Flying Cane and the 
	students were tasked with finding it. May not be all she seems to be.
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ppf_osh.png" class="fancybox" title="Oshare Bones">
	<img src="images/ppf_osh.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Oshare Bones"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Oshare Bones</strong><br> Known as Oshare Kobe in Japanese, which translates to "fashionable skeleton". 
	He is a FABULOUS skeleton who replaced Skeleton-T as the pathetic character who you will 
	swiftly trample over on your path to ultimate Puyo conquest.
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ppf_how.png" class="fancybox" title="Hohow Bird">
	<img src="images/ppf_how.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Hohow Bird"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Hohow Bird</strong><br> This annoying creature will annoy you 
	incessantly with his insistence to add "hm hmm" ("hohow" in the original Japanese) 
	randomly to his sentences and attack voices.
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ppf_oce.png" class="fancybox" title="Ocean Prince">
	<img src="images/ppf_oce.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Ocean Prince"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Ocean Prince</strong><br>A pink, fishy royalty. He speaks in an archaic dialect and in the English 
	script will quote the Bible in his attack voices for some reason.
	</td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><a href="images/ppf_yu.png" class="fancybox" title="Yu">
	<img src="images/ppf_yu.png" class="thumb_smaller" alt="Yu"></a></td>
	<td><strong>Yu</strong><br>A friendly ghost who loves to pun, giving English translators endless amounts of headaches.

<p>The story, as usual, will follow an easy, medium and hard course, where you get to play Amitie 
in the first two and Raffine in the latter. We see a return to the Sun type of story progression 
in Fever.</p>

<p>As for the gameplay we also see quite a prominent addition to the mechanic, namely the 
Fever mode. A Fever gauge is filled up similarly to the special power gauge in Yon by 
offsetting and a time counter, starting at 15 seconds, can also be increased through certain methods. Once the gauge fills up Fever mode starts.</p>

	<ul class="imglist">
	<li><a href="images/ppf_battle1.png" class="fancybox" title="Battle">
	<img src="images/ppf_battle1.png" class="thumb_small" alt="Battle"></a></li>
	<li><a href="images/ppf_battle2.png" class="fancybox" title="Fever Mode starts">
	<img src="images/ppf_battle2.png" class="thumb_small" alt="Fever Mode"></a></li>
	<li><a href="images/ppf_battle3.png" class="fancybox" title="Premade chains drop">
	<img src="images/ppf_battle3.png" class="thumb_small" alt="Premade chains"></a></li>
	</ul>
	
<p>In Fever mode you are given a pre-made chain which you can set off or build up into an even 
larger chain. The further you get in Fever mode, the larger the pre-made chains will be. 
The garbage generating power in Fever mode is significantly lower compared to chaining 
outside of Fever for obvious reasons, although the damage you can do there is still quite 
respectable. Once the timer runs out, you are returned to your previous state of the main board.</p>

<p>Like previous additions to the rule of Puyo, Fever adds a bit of flavor to the gameplay 
and gives you something else to think about. The main reason for Fever mode though, 
is that Sega decided to push the game to be much more beginner-friendly. The fun in Puyo 
comes from fighting your opponent with large chains and exchanging huge amounts of garbage, 
although for a beginner who can't chain well they are left feeling a bit excluded.</p>

	</ul>

<p>Unlike the previous two revisions of the Puyo rule, the Fever rule was actually mostly 
well-received among competitive circles. Many top players enjoy playing Fever rule as an 
alternative to the relatively bland Tsuu rule. On the other hand, due to the changes in the 
cast and artstyle, players who are fans of the original series ended up feeling a bit 
alienated and many are not fans of the Sega-introduced changes.</p>

<p>The PC release of Fever was also the first Puyo Puyo game that officially supported online play. 
The game was originally released with free online although recently Sega has locked the game to 
paid members only. It offers pretty good experience for players in or around Japan but due to 
the location of the server people in the West generally will get huge lags. It is still possible 
to play an earlier version of the game using an IP-to-IP method and for many Western players that 
is the method of choice if they want to play Fever mode against their pals.</p>
